# CSE 207 - Algorithms

This is for the CSE 207: Algorithms course at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific. This repo contains my own created notes writtered in markdown format. It also contains solutions of the Mid and Final questions for Spring 2023 semester. The solutions are written mostly in C or C++ programming language.

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in algorithm design and analysis. The course will cover the basic techniques for designing efficient algorithms and fundamental methods for analyzing their efficiency. The course will cover the following topics: algorithm analysis, sorting and searching, graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and approximation algorithms.
