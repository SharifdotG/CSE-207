## **Introduction**

- **Backtracking** is a technique used to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions.
- It is used to find the solution to a problem by exploring all possible solutions.
- It is used to find the optimal solution to a problem.
- It explores the solution space by making choices and backtracking when a choice leads to a dead end.
- It is often used to solve problems with constraints, where brute force is not feasible.
- It is used to solve problems with multiple solutions, where the goal is to find the best solution.

## **How Backtracking Works**

- **Backtracking** works by exploring all possible solutions to a problem.
- It starts by making empty choices and gradually fills in the choices to find the optimal solution.
- At each step, it makes a choice and explores the solution space.
- If the choice leads to a dead end, it backtracks and makes another choice.
- It continues exploring the solution space until it finds the optimal solution.
